        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>The scatter plot of study hours versus exam score shows a strong positive linear relationship, supported by a clearly upward-sloping trendline. As study hours increase, exam scores increase consistently. In contrast, the sleep-hours plot shows a weaker and more scattered pattern, suggesting sleep is less predictive of performance in this dataset. Based on visual strength and the slope value, study time appears to be the more influential variable.</p>

        <h3>Outlier</h3>
        <p>Student L appears to be a mild outlier because they scored 80 while sleeping 8 hours, performing slightly above others with similar study-hour ranges.</p>
